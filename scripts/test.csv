1,Aspartate Aminotransferase,"AST (aspartate aminotransferase) is an enzyme that is found mostly in the liver, but it's also in muscles and other organs in your body. When cells that contain AST are damaged, they release the AST into your blood. An AST blood test measures the amount of AST in your blood. The test is commonly used to help diagnose liver damage or disease.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/ast-test/,8-33,U/L
1,Alanine Aminotransferase,"ALT stands for alanine transaminase. It is an enzyme found mostly in the liver. An ALT test measures the amount of ALT in the blood.

When liver cells are damaged, they release ALT into the bloodstream. High levels of ALT in your blood may be a sign of a liver injury or disease. Some types of liver disease cause high ALT levels before you have symptoms of the disease. So, an ALT blood test may help diagnose certain liver diseases early.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/alt-blood-test/,7-56,U/L
1,Alkaline Phosphatase,"An alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test measures the amount of ALP in your blood. ALP is an enzyme found in many parts of your body. Each part of your body produces a different type of ALP. Most ALP is found in your liver, bones, kidneys, and digestive system.

Abnormal levels of ALP in your blood may be a sign of a wide range of health conditions, including liver disease, bone disorders, and chronic kidney disease. But an alkaline phosphatase test alone can't identify the source of ALP in your blood, so other tests are usually needed to make a diagnosis.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/alkaline-phosphatase/,44-147 ,IU/L
1,Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase,"A gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) test measures the amount of GGT in the blood. GGT is an enzyme found throughout the body, but it is mostly found in the liver. When the liver is damaged, GGT may leak into the bloodstream. High levels of GGT in the blood may be a sign of liver disease or damage to the bile ducts. Bile ducts are tubes that carry bile in and out of the liver. Bile is a fluid made by the liver. It is important for digestion.

A GGT test can't diagnose the specific cause of liver disease. So it is usually done along with or after other liver function tests, most often an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test. ALP is another type of liver enzyme. It's often used to help diagnose bone disorders as well as liver disease.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/gamma-glutamyl-transferase-ggt-test/,5-40,U/L
1,Total Bilirubin,"A bilirubin blood test measures the levels of bilirubin in your blood. Bilirubin is a yellowish substance made during your body's normal process of breaking down old red blood cells. Bilirubin is found in bile, a fluid your liver makes that helps you digest food.

If your liver is healthy, it will remove most of the bilirubin from your body. If your liver is damaged, bilirubin can leak out of your liver and into your blood. When too much bilirubin gets into the bloodstream, it can cause jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow. Signs of jaundice, along with a bilirubin blood test, can help your health care provider find out if you have liver disease.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/bilirubin-blood-test/,0.2-1.3,mg/dL
1,Direct Bilirubin," A Bilirubin Direct test is a medical laboratory analysis that measures the concentration of direct bilirubin in the blood.

1,Indirect Bilirubin,"This test measures the amount of bilirubin in your blood. Your body makes bilirubin when it breaks down hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells. The breakdown of hemoglobin is called hemolysis.

Your liver removes bilirubin from your body. So measuring bilirubin is a way to check how well your liver is working.",https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=167&contentid=indirect_bilirubin,0.2-0.7,mg/dL
1,Albumin,"An albumin blood test measures the amount of albumin in your blood. Low albumin levels can be a sign of liver or kidney disease or another medical condition. High levels may be a sign of dehydration.

Albumin is a protein made by your liver. Albumin enters your bloodstream and helps keep fluid from leaking out of your blood vessels into other tissues. It is also carries hormones, vitamins, and enzymes throughout your body. Without enough albumin, fluid can leak out of your blood and build up in your lungs, abdomen (belly), or other parts of your body.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/albumin-blood-test//,3.5-5.0,g/dL
1,Total Protein,"A total protein and albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio test measures the total amount of protein in your blood. There are two major types of protein in the blood:

Albumin, which helps keep blood from leaking out of blood vessels. It also helps move hormones, medicines, vitamins, and other important substances throughout the body. Albumin is made in the liver.
Globulins, which help fight infection and move nutrients throughout the body. Some globulins are made by the liver. Others are made by the immune system.
The test also compares the amount of albumin in your blood to the amount of globulin. The comparison is called the albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio.

If your total protein levels or A/G ratio results are not normal, it can be a sign of a serious health problem.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/total-protein-and-albumin-globulin-a-g-ratio//,6.3-8.0,g/dL
2,Sodium,"A sodium blood test measures the amount of sodium in your blood. Sodium is a type of electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals. They help control the amount of fluid and the balance of acids and bases (pH balance) in your body. Sodium also helps your nerves and muscles work properly.

You get most of the sodium you need in your diet. If you take in too much, your kidneys get rid of the extra sodium in your urine. Normally, your body keeps your sodium levels in a very narrow range. If your sodium blood levels are too high or too low, it may mean that you have a kidney problem, dehydration, or another type of medical condition.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/sodium-blood-test//,136-144,mEq/L
2,Potassium,"A potassium blood test measures the amount of potassium in your blood. Potassium is a type of electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help control fluid levels and the balance of acids and bases (pH balance) in your body.

2,Chloride,"A chloride blood test measures the amount of chloride in your blood. Chloride is a type of electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluids and the balance of acids and bases (pH balance) in your body. Chloride is often measured with other electrolytes to diagnose or monitor conditions, such as kidney disease, heart failure, liver disease, and high blood pressure.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/chloride-blood-test//,96-106,mEqL
2,Blood Urea Nitrogen,"A BUN, or blood urea nitrogen test, can provide important information about your kidney function. The main job of your kidneys is to remove waste and extra fluid from your body. If you have kidney disease, this waste material can build up in your blood. Over time, this may lead to serious health problems, including high blood pressure, anemia, and heart disease.

The BUN test measures the amount of urea nitrogen in your blood. Urea nitrogen is a waste product that your kidneys remove from your blood. Higher than normal BUN levels may be a sign that your kidneys aren't working well.

People with early kidney disease may not have any symptoms. A BUN test can help uncover kidney problems at an early stage when treatment can be more effective.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/bun-blood-urea-nitrogen//,6 - 24,mg/dL
2,Creatinine,"This test measures creatinine levels in blood and/or urine. Creatinine is a waste product made by your muscles as part of regular, everyday activity. Normally, your kidneys filter creatinine from your blood and send it out of the body in your urine. If there is a problem with your kidneys, creatinine can build up in the blood and less will be released in urine. If blood and/or urine creatinine levels are not normal, it can be a sign of kidney disease.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/creatinine-test//,0.7 - 1.3,mg/dL
2,Glucose,"A blood glucose test measures the glucose levels in your blood. Glucose is a type of sugar. It is your body's main source of energy. A hormone called insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells.

Too much or too little glucose in the blood can be a sign of a serious medical condition. High blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) may be a sign of diabetes, a disorder that can cause serious, long-term health conditions.

High blood sugar may also be caused by other conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood, such as problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands.

Low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia) are common among people with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes who take certain diabetes medicines. Certain conditions, such as liver disease, may cause low levels of blood glucose in people without diabetes, but this is uncommon. Without treatment, severe low blood sugar can lead to major health problems, including seizures and brain damage.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/blood-glucose-test//,70-99,mg/dL
2,Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate,"A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) test is a blood test that checks how well your kidneys are working. Your kidneys are two organs on either side of your spine near your waste. They have tiny filters called glomeruli. These filters remove waste and extra water from your blood and gets rid of them through urine (pee).

If your kidneys have been damaged by kidney disease, they can't filter your blood as fast as they should. A GFR test checks for kidney disease by measuring how much blood your kidneys filter each minute.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/glomerular-filtration-rate-gfr-test/,60 or higher,
3,Red Blood Cells,"A red blood cell (RBC) count measures the number of red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, in your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and stay healthy. An RBC count that is higher or lower than normal is often the first sign of an illness. So the test may allow you to get treatment even before you have symptoms.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/red-blood-cell-rbc-count/,depends on age and sex,mL
3,Hemoglobin,"A hemoglobin test measures the levels of hemoglobin in your blood. Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body.

3,Hematocrit,"A hematocrit test is a blood test that measures how much of your blood is made up of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. The other parts of your blood include white blood cells (to help fight infection), platelets (to help make blood clots to stop bleeding), and a liquid called plasma.

Hematocrit levels that are too high or too low can be a sign of a blood disorder, dehydration, or other medical conditions that affect your blood.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/hematocrit-test//,depends on age and sex,g/dL
3,Mean Corpuscular Volume,"MCV stands for mean corpuscular volume. An MCV blood test measures the average size of your red blood cells.

Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and stay healthy. If your red blood cells are too small or too large, it could be a sign of a blood disorder such as anemia, a lack of certain vitamins, or other medical conditions.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/mcv-mean-corpuscular-volume//,80-100,fl
3,Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin,"Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) is a measurement of the average amount of hemoglobin in each red blood cell. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to organs and tissues of your body.

An MCH test is one part of a panel of tests called the red blood cell (RBC) indices, which evaluate different characteristics and functions of red blood cells. MCH is a useful measurement for understanding how effectively oxygen is being distributed throughout the body. Changes in MCH or other RBC indices may be a sign of a blood disorder called anemia.",https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-are-mch-levels,26-33,pg
3,Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration,"Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) describes the average hemoglobin concentration in a given volume of red blood cells. It's a lab value that's found on a complete blood count (CBC). An MCHC blood test may be used as a preliminary check for anemia.

A normal MCHC value on a CBC is typically between 32 to 36 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or 320 to 360 grams per liter (g/L). A higher or lower than normal MCHC value may indicate that you have a type of anemia, which means you have a low red blood cell count, but your healthcare provider may order more diagnostic tests to be sure.1

3,Platelets,"Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are small blood cells that are essential for blood clotting. Clotting is the process that helps you stop bleeding after an injury. There are two types of platelet tests: a platelet count test and platelet function tests.

A platelet count test measures the number of platelets in your blood. A lower than normal platelet count is called thrombocytopenia. This condition can cause you to bleed too much after a cut or other injury that causes bleeding. A higher than normal platelet count is called thrombocytosis. This can make your blood clot more than you need it to. Blood clots can be dangerous because they can block blood flow.

Platelet function tests check your platelets' ability to form clots.",https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/platelet-tests//,"150,000-400,000",mL
4,Total Cholestrol,A measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood. It includes both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.,https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterollevelswhatyouneedtoknow.html,125-200,mg/dL
4,Low Density Lipoprotein,LDL is low-density lipoprotein. This is the “bad” cholesterol that contributes to plaque buildup in your arteries.

5,Iron,"Iron is a mineral that our bodies need for many functions. For example, iron is part of hemoglobin, a protein which carries oxygen from our lungs throughout our bodies. It helps our muscles store and use oxygen. Iron is also part of many other proteins and enzymes.

Your body needs the right amount of iron. If you have too little iron, you may develop iron deficiency anemia. Causes of low iron levels include blood loss, poor diet, or an inability to absorb enough iron from foods. People at higher risk of having too little iron are young children and women who are pregnant or have periods.",https://medlineplus.gov/iron.html,70 - 175,mcg/dl
5,Total Iron Binding Capacity,"A blood test that measures your blood’s ability (capacity) to attach (bind) to iron and carry it throughout your body. Healthcare providers use it to help diagnose iron-deficiency anemia and other iron metabolism conditions.

More specifically, a TIBC test shows the amount of transferrin in your blood. Transferrin is a protein your liver makes that regulates the absorption of iron into your blood.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/24979-total-iron-binding-capacity-tibc,240-450,mcg/dL
5,Transferrin Saturation,"Transferrin is a protein that binds to iron and carries it through the blood. Transferrin saturation, abbreviated TS and measured as a percentage, is the ratio of serum iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). TS is a more useful indicator of iron status than just iron or TIBC alone. In iron deficiency, the iron level is low but the TIBC is increased, thus transferrin saturation becomes very low. In iron overload states, such as hemochromatosis, the iron level will be high and the TIBC will be low or normal, causing transferrin saturation to increase. It is customary to test for transferrin saturation when evaluating a person’s nutritional status or liver function. Transferrin saturation levels may also be used in the diagnoses of anemia.",https://healthmatters.io/understand-blood-test-results/transferrin-saturation,15 - 55,%
